# Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to my Tic-Tac-Toe game repository! This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How to Play

To play the game, simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You will see a 3x3 grid representing the Tic-Tac-Toe board. Players take turns clicking on the cells to make their moves. The first player is 'X' and the second player is 'O'. The game continues until one player wins by getting three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or if all cells are filled without any player winning, resulting in a draw.

## Features

- Clean and intuitive user interface.
- Responsive design, suitable for desktop and mobile browsers.
- Simple gameplay mechanics.
- Clear indication of game status, including whose turn it is and when the game is won or drawn.

## Files

This repository contains the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the game.
- `style.css`: The CSS file responsible for styling the game interface.
- `first.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.
